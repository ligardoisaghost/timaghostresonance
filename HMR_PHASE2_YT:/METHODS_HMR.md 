### YouTube Shorts performance dataset (Phase-2)

This repository includes three core CSV files derived from the
*the return of el ligardo* YouTube Shorts analytics export.

- **Totals.csv**  
  Daily channel-level totals (views and watch time). Each row is one calendar
  date for the channel. Used to track overall momentum and “phase” shifts.

- **Table data.csv**  
  Per-video summary metrics for each Short in the dataset. Columns include
  views, watch time (hours), engaged views, and average percentage viewed.
  Row 0 is an aggregate “All videos” row and is documented as such in the
  data dictionary.

- **Chart data.csv**  
  Daily views per video. Each row corresponds to one video on one date,
  with the associated video title, publish timestamp, and duration. This file
  is used for growth-curve analysis and Human–Model Resonance (HMR)
  fingerprinting.
